    Although it is possible to package this service as a
    traditional WAR file for deployment to an external
    application server, the simpler approach demonstrated
    below creates a standalone application.
    You package everything in a single, executable JAR
    file, driven by a good old Java main() method.
    Along the way, you use Springâ€™s support for
    embedding the Tomcat servlet container as the HTTP
    runtime, instead of deploying to an external instance.
